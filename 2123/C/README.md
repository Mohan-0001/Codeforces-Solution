### Problem Statement
You are given an array $a$ of distinct integers.In one operation, you may either:   choose a nonempty prefix$^{\text{∗}}$ of $a$ and replace it with its minimum value, or  choose a nonempty suffix$^{\text{†}}$ of $a$ and replace it with its maximum value. Note that you may choose the entire array $a$.For each element $a_i$, determine if there exists some sequence of operations to transform $a$ into $[a_i]$; that is, make the array $a$ consist of only one element, which is $a_i$. Output your answer as a binary string of length $n$, where the $i$-th character is $1$ if there exists a sequence to transform $a$ into $[a_i]$, and $0$ otherwise.$^{\text{∗}}$A prefix of an array is a subarray consisting of the first $k$ elements of the array, for some integer $k$.$^{\text{†}}$A suffix of an array is a subarray consisting of the last $k$ elements of the array, for some integer $k$.

### Input Specification
The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 ≤q t ≤q 10^4$)  — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains one integer $n$ ($2 ≤q n ≤q 2\cdot 10^5$) — the size of the array $a$.The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers, $a_1,a_2,...,a_n$ ($1 ≤q a_i ≤q 10^6$). It is guaranteed that all $a_i$ are distinct.It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2\cdot 10^5$.

### Output Specification
For each test case, output a binary string of length $n$  — the $i$-th character should be $1$ if there exists a sequence of operations as described above, and $0$ otherwise.

### Example
**Input:**
```text
361 3 5 4 7 2413 10 12 2071 2 3 4 5 6 7
```

**Output:**
```text
100011
1101
1000001
```

### Explanation
In the first sample, you can first choose the prefix of size $3$. Then the array is transformed into 1472 Next, you can choose the suffix of size $2$. Then the array is transformed into 147 Finally, you can choose the prefix of size $3$. Then the array is transformed into 1 So we see that it is possible to transform $a$ into $[1]$.It can be shown that it is impossible to transform $a$ into $[3]$.
