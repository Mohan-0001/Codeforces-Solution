### Problem Statement
The classic programming language of Bitland is Bit++. This language is so peculiar and complicated.The language is that peculiar as it has exactly one variable, called x. Also, there are two operations:  Operation ++ increases the value of variable x by 1.  Operation -- decreases the value of variable x by 1. A statement in language Bit++ is a sequence, consisting of exactly one operation and one variable x. The statement is written without spaces, that is, it can only contain characters "+", "-", "X". Executing a statement means applying the operation it contains.A programme in Bit++ is a sequence of statements, each of them needs to be executed. Executing a programme means executing all the statements it contains.You're given a programme in language Bit++. The initial value of x is 0. Execute the programme and find its final value (the value of the variable when this programme is executed).

### Input Specification
The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 150) — the number of statements in the programme.Next n lines contain a statement each. Each statement contains exactly one operation (++ or --) and exactly one variable x (denoted as letter «X»). Thus, there are no empty statements. The operation and the variable can be written in any order.

### Output Specification
Print a single integer — the final value of x.
